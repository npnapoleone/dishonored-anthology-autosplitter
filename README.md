# Dishonored Anthology Autosplitter

The Dishonored Anthology Autosplitter is designed to support back-to-back-to-back(-to-back-to-back) runs of Dishonored series games. The timer will automatically stop its in-game timer when a run is complete, and resume only when the next game has reached the appropriate start point.

## v1.0:
  - Supports running on D1 Main Game, D2 and DOTO in any order
  - To use, download `dishonored1.asl`, `dishonored2.asl`, and `doto.asl`
  - In your LiveSplit layout, add three `Scriptable Auto Splitter` components [like so](https://imgur.com/a/jeZCdGy)
  - Ensure that your timer mode is set to in-game time
